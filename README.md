*Learning Flask, a Python web framework*

I use this project to learn how Flask works step by step. **Don't use it in productions!**

Git will help me setting milestones while the project keeps growing. Once I learn something new I can go back to the previous situation and try to repeat all the steps by myself till I can do it without any help.
